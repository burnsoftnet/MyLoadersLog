# Getting Started Tips

The My Loaders Log (MLL) application was designed to keep track of your reloading inventory and the configurations (materials used to make the ammunition that you use). Since this application keeps track of your materials (bullets, cases, primers, powder, hulls, wads, etc.. you will need to put in your current inventory of the materials that you have.  It is something that you do not have, just leave the qty and price at 0 or blank.  Leaving the price and qty blank will allow you to put in configurations from other reloading manuals which will allow you to store everything in once place and you can also search to compare information based on your configurations and what you have created.

By Keeping track of the materials that are in your inventory, the MLL is able to also tell you how much it costs to make 1 round of ammunition and based on the materials that you have listed it will tell you how many rounds you can make of that particular configuration.  It also has the ability to "Make Ammunition ready to use" feature that will allow you to store your inventory of ready to use ammunition, and it will also subtract the materials that were used from inventory.  If you used the My Gun Collection (MGC) application, you can export the ammunition inventory from the MLL to the MGC. The MLL will also import the firearms in your collection from the MGC to the Firearm List in the MLL.  The Firearm list is used for the loaders log so you can store which firearm was used to test out which configuration.

When you are getting started, you will need to the following before creating a configuration:

* Put in your Name and what the title of your loads are going to be.
* Put in your current inventory of  Primers.
* Put in your current inventory of Cases/Brass (Rifle & Pistol Reloaders).
* Put in your current inventory of Powders.
* Put in your current inventory of Bullets (Rifle & Pistol Reloaders).
* Put in your current inventory of WADS (Shotgun Reloaders).
* Put in your current inventory of Shell Hulls (Shotgun Reloaders).
* Put in your current inventory of  Shot &/ Slugs (Shotgun Reloaders).
* Put in the Caliber's that you reload for.
* Add in / import your firearm collection to the MLL database.
