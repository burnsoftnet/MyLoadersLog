# Copy Loaders Log Entry

From my experience, the loaders log can vary a lot or very little from the last test.   Of course re-writing everything again is always a hassle.  That is where the Copy function will come in handy!  Now you can copy an existing log entry and modify the little tweaks that you did for this new test.

While you are viewing the Loaders Log, click on the entry that you want to copy to select the row, then right click to pull down the menu options, select Copy to bring up the copy form.
