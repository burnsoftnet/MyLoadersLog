# View Configuration Sheets - History/Audit

![](images/View_Config_Audit.jpg)

The History/Audit is just a way you can see how many rounds of ammunition was created by using the Make Live Ammunition Feature that this program has.  When you use that feature will mark the date and time that it was used, the qty that was made, the total cost for making that amount and the cost per round.   This is a simple way to see if the cost of building ammunition has gone up or down and can also be used to compare costs with manufactured ammunition for that time period.
