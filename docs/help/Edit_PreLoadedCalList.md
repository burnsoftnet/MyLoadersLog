# Edit Pre-Loaded Caliber Lists

The My Loaders Log application comes pre loaded with a list of calibers already listed in the database.  This is mostly used as an auto suggest feature when you are adding a caliber to your list.

If you wanted to Edit, Delete or Add Calibers to that list, you can do so by clicking on Edit | Pre-Loaded Caliber Lists
