# Add WADs to Inventory

You can store information about different types of WADs either to keep track of your own inventory or to list for reference.  To add WADs to the database just click on Add Item | WAD  to access the Add WAD Form.

Everything on the form requires input except for the Qty, and Price.   The information that is required is used for the configurations.  If you wish to just put the WAD in just to use as a reference based on a configuration that you got from a friend or from a book, just leave the qty and Price fields blank.  Any time you use the "Make Ready to use Ammunition" feature it will subtract what you have in inventory.
