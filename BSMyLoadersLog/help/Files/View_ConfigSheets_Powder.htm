<p>The Powder Tab is the second tab while viewing a configuration.&nbsp; This will list
all the powders Loads, FPS and CUP/Pressure associated with the configuration.</p>

<p>The Picture above show a list of powders that can be used.&nbsp; This Configuration was
referred by a reloading manual and was added to the My Loaders log.&nbsp; You don't need
to have multiple powders listed for your load you can have a minimum of 1 powder list, as
I do with my personal Loads as shown below</p>

<p>The amount of powder that I used was only 23.5, no min or max on this configuration and
since I do not have a way to figure out the FPS, that was left blank as well.</p>

<p>Remember, if you do not want to display the FPS or CUPs while viewing a Configuration,
you can disable them in the application <a href="Tools_Options.htm#m">Options section
under the Misc Tab</a>.</p>

<p>Of Course if you wish to add more powders to this configuration, you can just by
Clicking on the <font color="#0000FF"><em>Add</em></font> button.&nbsp; <a

Configuration.</p>
