<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Loaders Log allow you to store the test that you have done on
one of your firearms with a specific load that you created.&nbsp; The My Loaders Log
application was initially built to keep track of details of the Loader/Reloaders Log in
one central place, But also to store more information on what went into making that load.
&nbsp; By allowing you to store configuration of the loads that you have made, it made it
quick and easy to add information to the loaders log just by selecting the configuration
that you use, and fill out the Date tested, distance, no. of rounds, condition and length.
&nbsp; Quick and easy, but there are times you tested something out and didn't want to add
that configuration to the database or you want to move all your logs from paper to the
computer but didn't want to add all the inventory information.&nbsp; That is where being
able to add to the loaders log manually comes in handy.&nbsp; The Manual option is a free
form that will allow you to input all the need fields to add to the log.&nbsp; The only
thing that you will have to select from an inventory is the firearm that it was tested on.</p>
