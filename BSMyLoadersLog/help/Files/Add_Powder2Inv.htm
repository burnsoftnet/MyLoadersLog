<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can store information about different types of powders either to
keep track of your own inventory or to list for reference.&nbsp; To add powders to the
database just click on <font color="#0000FF"><em>Add Item</em></font> | <font
color="#0000FF"><em>Powder</em></font>&nbsp; to access the Add Powder Form.</p>

<p>The only thing that is required on this form is the Manufacturer and the Name.
&nbsp; The Weight in pounds and price is optional.&nbsp; If you just fill out the
Manufacturer and the Name you can reference this powder in one of your configurations.
&nbsp; If you wish to keep track of the amount of powder that you have in inventory and
the cost of powder used for your configuration, then you will need to type in the weight
in pounds and the price.&nbsp; This is based off a new case of powder, since they are sold
in pounds.&nbsp; It will keep track of it by breaking down the number of pounds to grains
(6999.99 grains = 1 lbs.), and the price per grain.&nbsp; Any time you use the &quot;Make
Ready to use Ammunition&quot; feature it will subtract what you have in inventory.</p>
