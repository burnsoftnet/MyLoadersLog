<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The My Loaders Log (MLL) application was designed to keep track of
your reloading inventory and the configurations (materials used to make the ammunition
that you use). Since this application keeps track of your materials (bullets, cases,
primers, powder, hulls, wads, etc.. you will need to put in your current inventory of the
materials that you have.&nbsp; It is something that you do not have, just leave the qty
and price at 0 or blank.&nbsp; Leaving the price and qty blank will allow you to put in
configurations from other reloading manuals which will allow you to store everything in
once place and you can also search to compare information based on your configurations and
what you have created.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Keeping track of the materials that are in your inventory, the
MLL is able to also tell you how much it costs to make 1 round of ammunition and based on
the materials that you have listed it will tell you how many rounds you can make of that
particular configuration.&nbsp; It also has the ability to &quot;Make Ammunition ready to
use&quot; feature that will allow you to store your inventory of ready to use ammunition,
and it will also subtract the materials that were used from inventory.&nbsp; If you used
the My Gun Collection (MGC) application, you can export the ammunition inventory from the
MLL to the MGC. The MLL will also import the firearms in your collection from the MGC to
the Firearm List in the MLL.&nbsp; The Firearm list is used for the loaders log so you can
store which firearm was used to test out which configuration.</p>

<p>When you are getting started, you will need to the following before creating a
configuration:

  <li><a href="Tools_Options.htm#ud">Put in your Name and what the title of your loads are
    going to be</a>.</li>
