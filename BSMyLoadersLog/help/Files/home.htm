<p>The My Loaders Log Application allows you to keep track of your reloading equipment,
the amount of materials that you have and store reloading configurations in one central
location.&nbsp; Other Details that this application can help you with are: 

<ul>
  <li>Keep a running inventory of your reloading equipment, this will also keep track of the
    total amount of money that you have spent on your reloading equipment</li>
  <li>Keep an inventory on the amount of materials that you have to make ammunition, this
    includes cases, powder, bullets, and primers.</li>
  <li>Keep a Loaders log of the tests on the ammunition that you created.</li>
  <li>Keep a small list of the firearms in your collection or just the ones that you used to
    test the ammunition that you created.</li>
  <li>If you are a current My Gun Collection application user for firearm inventory, you will
    be able to import your firearm collection to the My Loaders Log application.</li>
  <li>If you are a current My Gun Collection application user to also keep track of the
    ammunition that you have in stock, you can export that ammunition that you created to the
    My Gun Collection application.&nbsp; This will save you time from having to re-enter
    everything to keep track of the ammunition that you have in stock.</li>
  <li>Keep track of the materials that you used to make a certain kind of ammunition. &nbsp;
    AKA Ammunition Configurations/Configurations.</li>
  <li>If you keep track of your materials in stock (qty and cost), the configurations will
    also tell you how much on round of ammunition is.</li>
  <li>Not only can you have custom configurations stored in this application, you can also put
    in other information from other reloaders manuals.</li>
  <li>Print out Reports on the Equipment that you have in stock.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Print out Reports on the materials that you have in stock or all the materials that you
    are out of.</li>
</ul>

<p><big><strong>NOTE:&nbsp; Shotshell reloaders, this program was suppose to also contain
a section for shotgun reloading, but due to the lack of knowledge in shotshell reloading
we had to keep those sections hidden until we are able to gather more information about
shotshell reloading.&nbsp; Hopefully in the next release we will have the shotgun section
completed.</strong></big></p>
