# Developer Notes

This is just some small notes that help with the development and support of this application.

## Branches

The *Main* Branch will contain the current release code.  Changes will be in the *develop* branch.  
For new Changes create a branch from the *develop* branch and make your changes.  Then Create a pull request
to merge into *develop*.  Once all the changes are ready for release, create a pull request to merge 
*develop* into *main*.  Once the release has been merged into main.  Create a new Branch from Main called
*release/vX.X.X* as a backup for the production release.

## GitHub Pages

Currently this is using the [leapday theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/leap-day)  
So any updates that is needed will need to be taken from that github repo.

### List of Customized items

Below is a list of customized items for the leapday theme that I modified for my use.
Things that will have to be backedup or updated if a newer lead day theme was used.
All located in the docs folder

* _includes/main_menu.html
* _layouts/default.html



## Things to Do Before Release

* Update the Change Log with Release Version and any additional information
* Update the Online Help with Any new Pages that are needed
* Build the Setup MSI Package
* Create the Release On Github with Change Log Details
* Update the Github Pages Main README with the Change Log Information.
