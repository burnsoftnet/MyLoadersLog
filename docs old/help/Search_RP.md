# Search - Rifle & Pistol Configurations

The Search Rifle & Pistol Configuration section was created to allow you to search for specific things through all your configurations.  This is a very handy tool if you have a lot of personal configurations, Imports, or Configurations that you copied from a book.  It will allow you to look and filter through all the configuration and give you a list of all the data that was found.

To Access the Search Rifle and Pistols section just click on Search | Rifle and Pistols.

The Show SQL button will allow you to see or modify the SQL Statement that is used to create the results in the next window.  If you know how to create SQL statements, then this might be useful to you.  The SQL Statements is what is stored for the Saved Report functions, so if you make a SQL Statement that is not a stock statement (meaning you use the interface to create it), it still could be saved so you don't have to do it again.

When you click on the Show SQL button, it will expand the window above to the following window.

The Regular Reports will allow you to export the reports to an Excel file or PDF File.
